  about:
    My Name is Stefan Farnik and I'm living in Innsbruck in Austria.<br />
    I am a System Engineer, where my focus lies on the Microsoft portfolio, following a Windows client through its deployment using System Center Configuration Manager and Management using Group Policy & Preferences and a lot of scripting (for me PowerShell and VBScript are the most prominently used languages).
