    I'm happy to welcome you to my blog.
    In my job I learned a lot from the community, posts in various Forums (eg. TechNet), scripts, snippets and blog articles from MVPs and/or other tech savy folk. Sure, I also made my own experiences and gained a lot of knowledge myself.

Hello curious folk!

I'm happy to welcome you to my blog.
In my job (see below or more detailed on [about](/about/)) I relied heavily on the knowledge of others, which I found in the community around Microsoft & Windows - in various Forums (eg. TechNet), scripts, snippets and blog articles from MVPs and/or other tech savy folk. Sure I also made my own experiences and gained a lot of knowledge myself.

Now, 10+ years later, I decided it's time to give something back. Back to the giants on whose shoulders I stood at my own beginning.
Sure, they (you?) may not quite need it, but then - hopefully - people new to this job can learn from me.

I will cover things like System Center Configuration Manager, Windows Policies (GPO & GPP), Internet Explorer & Microsoft Edge, PowerShell & VBScript and other job related things.

It also may happen that I share some private insights and thoughts, articles about things I regularly (have to) use, information about setup & configuration about the blog itself, etc, ...

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you'll visit again.

All the best,<br />Stefan
